Hodur is a domain modeling approach and collection of libraries to
Clojure.

By using Hodur you can define your domain model as data, parse and
validate it, and then either consume your model via an API or use one
of the many plugins to help you achieve mechanical results faster and
in a purely functional manner.

* Motivation

  For a deeper insight into the motivations behind Hodur, check the [[./docs/MOTIVATION.org][motivation doc]].

* Getting Started

Add ~hodur-engine~ as a dependency in your ~deps.edn~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  {:deps {:hodur-engine {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}}
#+END_SRC

TBD: initialize with data

TBD: initialize with file
